# API-training

A simple program meant to teach me how to use APIs. 
I came up with the idea based off of an old weather app I had many years ago. 
The only issue it currently has is that you need to allow mixed content, 
since one of the APIs requires me to pay in order to give me the https call, 
and I'm not going to.

Ideally I'd look for free to use APIs, but god knows geoloc seems to be nigh impossible. Will also look into using postman next time.
